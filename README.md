# courses-platform
Project for web client environment, course platform in which we have a structure of students, teachers and courses. With this I will make a small outline of what will be my integrated project.
At the beginning we will have only the administration of students by teachers, where a teacher can only make changes on students (each student will have only one teacher, but teachers will have several students in their charge).

Administrators will be able to add teachers and teachers will be able to add students under their responsibility.

The teacher will have the following data: name (text), id (number), classroom (coordinates) and if he uses the platform (boolean).

The student will have the following data: name (text), id (number), classroom (coordinates) and if they attend (boolean).
